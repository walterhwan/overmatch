# OverMatch

OverMatch is a single-page app that can help you form your dream Overwatch team.


## Background and Overview

In Overwatch, there are many characters with different roles in following categories: tank, defense, offense, and support. We are trying to build an application that helps players form a team with each other based on their stats, heroes preference, and desired team formation. Once the team is formed, players can decide if they would like to add contacts and team up together in Overwatch.
