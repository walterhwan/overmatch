# OverMatch

OverMatch is a single-page app that can help you form your dream Overwatch team.


## Background and Overview

In Overwatch, there are many characters with different roles in following categories: tank, defense, offense, and support. We are trying to build an application that helps players form a team with each other based on their stats, heroes preference, and desired team formation. Once the team is formed, players can decide if they would like to add contacts and team up together in Overwatch.

## Technologies & Technical Challenges

Backend: MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js
Frontend: React, Redux, JavaScript
Messaging share system: Websocket

#### Battle.net OAuth 2.0 API

By using OAuth, we can let Blizzard handle the authentication process and receive a unique ID representing that user, then use an access token to gain access to allowed resources like their Overwatch Battle tags, most frequently used Heros, and competitive rank.
